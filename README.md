# 4. What is the shipping performance like ‚Äì are there delays between order and ship date?
## Key Insight Summary:

 If days_to_ship > avg_days_for_that_ship_mode ‚Üí Delayed
 Else ‚Üí On-Time
 
| Ship Mode      | Average Shipping Time (days) |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Same Day       | 0 days        |
| First Class    | 2 days        |
| Second Class   | 3 days        |
| Standard Class | 5 days        |
