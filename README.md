The **Consumer** segment makes up **52%** of the customer base and shows a steady upward trend year over year, especially **peaking in Q4** — likely due to seasonal buying behavior. 

Meanwhile, **Corporate and Home Office** segments grow more modestly but **follow the same seasonal spikes.**

- Starting in **2016**, there is a notable **shift** in customer dynamics across all segments.
- The number of new customers sharply **declines after 2015**, while the **count of returning customers significantly increases.**
- This trend becomes more pronounced from **2017** onwards, where the volume of **new customer** acquisition remains consistently **low**, while **returning customers** **dominate** the customer base.
- This pattern is consistent across all three customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), indicating a system-wide **slowdown in customer acquisition**, but a possible **improvement in retention or repeat purchasing behavior.**

### 4.2.4 Sales by Customer Segmentation

**1. Consumer Segment Leads in Sales**
- **The Consumer segment** consistently contributes the **highest monthly sales across all four years.**
- It also exhibits **strong peaks**, particularly toward the end of each year (**Q4**), likely driven by seasonal demand (e.g., holiday shopping, promotions).

**2. Corporate Segment Shows Strong Growth**
- **The Corporate segment** starts behind Consumer but demonstrates **steady and visible growth.**
- In late **2018**, it nearly **matches or surpasses Consumer in some months** — a signal that this segment is becoming more important.
- This may reflect increasing purchases from businesses, possibly due to B2B expansion or enterprise deals.

**3. Home Office Segment Is the Smallest but Growing**
- **The Home Office segment** has the **lowest monthly sales.**
- However, there's a noticeable **upward trend in the second half of the timeline (2017–2018)**.
- Growth acceleration in this segment may indicate increased remote or small business setups, potentially worth targeting with tailored marketing.

**4. Seasonality & Spikes**
- All three segments show clear seasonality, with **consistent spikes** during: **Q4** Possibly due to year-end promotions.

Actionable Next Steps:
- Double down on **Q4** **campaigns**, especially for the **Consumer** segment, where demand peaks sharply.
- Nurture **Corporate accounts** — invest in B2B relationship-building to further grow that segment.
- Explore the **Home Office segment** — it's small but **growing steadily**. Consider specialized offers or products for this niche.
- Use this segmentation trend to predict future revenue streams and prioritize marketing budgets accordingly.

### 4.2.3 AOV Over the Year

- Overall AOV shows a slight downward trend over the years, indicating that while total sales may increase, customers are placing slightly smaller orders on average.
- The majority of AOV values hover between $450 and $550, suggesting a relatively stable purchasing behavior overall.

Notable dips are observed in Q2 periods, especially:
- In Q2 of 2018, where the AOV dropped significantly below the typical range — potentially indicating promotions, discounting, or smaller transactions during that quarter.
- This Q2 dip pattern is worth further investigation to understand whether it's driven by seasonality, pricing strategies, or a shift in product mix.

### 4.2.3 AOV by Segment Over the Year

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a353e789-2fb0-42de-a4fa-3a78e89a8485)

**1. Spikes and Anomalies**
- Q1 2015 (**Jan** **2015**): The Home Office segment had an **exceptionally high AOV**, significantly skewing the graph.
- Investigate if this spike was due to **large orders, special contracts, or data quality issues.**

**2. Overall Trends (2015–2018)**
- **Corporate and Home Office segments** tend to have **higher AOVs** than Consumer, especially post-2016.
- **The Consumer segment** has the **most stable and moderate AOV** across quarters, though generally lower.
- This aligns with expectations where individual customers purchase in smaller quantities or lower-ticket items.

**3. Seasonality or Patterns**
- No strong or consistent seasonal AOV pattern across quarters.
- Some random peaks suggest potential bulk purchasing, promotions, or budget season spending.

Actionable Next Steps:

**Corporate and Home Office** clients are more valuable per transaction — this suggests:
- Potential for account-based sales strategy (focus on fewer, high-value clients).
- Consider developing exclusive pricing tiers or loyalty programs for them.
- Consumer segment may offer volume but with lower AOV — leverage this with bundled deals, upselling, or promotions.
- **Consumer brings the traffic, Home Office brings the margin**
