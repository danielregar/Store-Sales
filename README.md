![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0556b94c-ded5-453b-b3eb-297ce3779e62)

**1. Consumer Segment Leads in Sales**
- **The Consumer segment** consistently contributes the **highest monthly sales across all four years.**

- **The Home Office segment** has the **lowest monthly sales.**
- However, there's a noticeable **upward trend in the second half of the timeline (2017–2018)**.
- Growth acceleration in this segment may indicate increased remote or small business setups, potentially worth targeting with tailored marketing.

**4. Seasonality & Spikes**

- Overall AOV shows a slight downward trend over the years, indicating that while total sales may increase, customers are placing slightly smaller orders on average.
- The majority of AOV values hover between $450 and $550, suggesting a relatively stable purchasing behavior overall.

Notable dips are observed in Q2 periods, especially:
- In Q2 of 2018, where the AOV dropped significantly below the typical range — potentially indicating promotions, discounting, or smaller transactions during that quarter.
- This Q2 dip pattern is worth further investigation to understand whether it's driven by seasonality, pricing strategies, or a shift in product mix.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a353e789-2fb0-42de-a4fa-3a78e89a8485)

**1. Spikes and Anomalies**
- Q1 2015 (**Jan** **2015**): The Home Office segment had an **exceptionally high AOV**, significantly skewing the graph.
- Investigate if this spike was due to **large orders, special contracts, or data quality issues.**

**2. Overall Trends (2015–2018)**
- **Corporate and Home Office segments** tend to have **higher AOVs** than Consumer, especially post-2016.
- **The Consumer segment** has the **most stable and moderate AOV** across quarters, though generally lower.
- This aligns with expectations where individual customers purchase in smaller quantities or lower-ticket items.

**3. Seasonality or Patterns**
- No strong or consistent seasonal AOV pattern across quarters.
- Some random peaks suggest potential bulk purchasing, promotions, or budget season spending.

Actionable Next Steps:

**Corporate and Home Office** clients are more valuable per transaction — this suggests:
- Potential for account-based sales strategy (focus on fewer, high-value clients).
- Consider developing exclusive pricing tiers or loyalty programs for them.
- Consumer segment may offer volume but with lower AOV — leverage this with bundled deals, upselling, or promotions.
- **Consumer brings the traffic, Home Office brings the margin**
